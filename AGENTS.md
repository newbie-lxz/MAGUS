# Root Agent Guide

## Scope

- This root workspace is the MAGUS pipeline. It contains Stage `A`, Stage `B`, Stage `C`, the downstream Stage `D` verifier, and the final Report stage. The root orchestration layer connects Stage `A` through Report.
- Stage `A` still owns code extraction, derived sample generation, and LLM evidence export.
- Stage `B` owns pattern mining and candidate scoring over Stage `A` stats records, then prepares a route-aggregated C-ready audit queue from matching Stage `A` LLM evidence plus Stage `B` metadata.
- Stage `C` owns two-agent adversarial audit and routing over Stage `B` C-ready candidates.
- Stage `D` owns dynamic source/API verification over the Stage `C` candidates placed under `c/out/*.jsonl`.
- Report owns final vulnerability report generation from Stage `D` reportable/failed verification outputs. Reportable records are either D-confirmed findings or Stage `C` `P0`/`P1` findings preserved because D explicitly returned `UNSUPPORTED_ORACLE`; `P2` unsupported-oracle records stay in failed output for audit.

## Repo Map

- `tools/sanitize_juliet_tree.py`: explicit helper that generates the label-neutralized `srcs_sanitized/` Juliet copy and `juliet_sanitization_map.json`
- `tools/gen_srcs_compile_commands.py`: explicit helper that generates `srcs_sanitized/compile_commands.json` for the sanitized Juliet sample tree using the Linux Win32 shim include path, Juliet `testcasesupport`, `_WIN32`, and the shared `tools/juliet_win_shim/juliet_win_compat.h` forced include by default

## Engineering Rules

- Do not use patch-style design. Fix the actual contract or data-flow boundary, and carry the change through code, docs, and verification.
- Do not use compatibility-style design unless the user explicitly asks for backward compatibility. When a contract changes, migrate callers and documentation in the same change instead of keeping old and new paths alive.
- Do not use fallback-style design. Required inputs must be validated and missing or malformed data must fail explicitly instead of being silently guessed or substituted.
- Every requested implementation must be completed end to end when feasible: code, orchestration, documentation, and verification commands.
- MAGUS must remain a general C/C++ vulnerability analysis pipeline. Juliet is only a benchmark/test corpus and must not define core behavior, thresholds, ranking weights, routing rules, verifier semantics, or reportability policy.
- Do not tune implementation behavior against Juliet answers, bad/good labels, sanitized case labels, CWE folder names, report metrics, false-positive lists, false-negative lists, or `test/run_lazy_batch.py` outcomes. Evaluation scripts may read answers only after a run is complete, and evaluation results must feed docs/metrics, not production heuristics.
- Core stages `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and Report must not read Juliet ground truth, sanitization reverse maps, benchmark answer files, or evaluation outputs. Benchmark-specific code must stay in explicit test/evaluation helpers or tools invoked by command-line sidecars and must not affect generic candidate scoring, red-team routing, oracle-profile selection, preservation policy, or final reporting.
- Any optimization for throughput or quality must be justified by project-agnostic C/C++ semantics, measurable resource behavior, or public API contracts. If a proposed change mentions Juliet-specific filenames, `bad`/`good`, `case0`/`case1`, CWE folder queues, or known benchmark outcomes, treat it as suspect until it is recast as a generic rule and verified on non-Juliet inputs.

## Current Behavior

- `pipeline.py a` runs Stage `A` only, including `samples.llm.jsonl` export beside the raw output.
- `pipeline.py gen-input` generates a Stage `A` projects JSONL from `compile_commands.json`; it defaults to `srcs_sanitized` and does not run Stage `A`.
- `pipeline.py b` runs Stage `B` only over Stage `A` stats and matching LLM evidence.
- `pipeline.py c` runs Stage `C` over Stage `B` `candidates.for_c.jsonl`, routing completed `P0` static confirmations and `P1`/`P2` dynamic candidates to Stage `D`, and routing `P3` audit-only records to audit output.
- `pipeline.py d` runs Stage `D` over Stage `C` `c/out/*.jsonl` by calling `d/memberD_verifier/02_run_with_C/01_auto_attack_from_C_linux.sh`; the script runs Report after D validation. Project-specific D execution contexts are loaded only when `--contexts` / `D_CONTEXTS` is supplied.
- `pipeline.py report` generates the final report from a Stage `D` output directory.
- `pipeline.py abcd` chains Stage `A` and Stage `B`, streams Stage `C` dynamic candidates into Stage `D` while Stage `C` is still running, writes the D run under `d/memberD_verifier/02_run_with_C/output/<run-name>/`, then runs Report from that D output. Project-specific D execution contexts are loaded only when `--d-contexts` / `D_CONTEXTS` is supplied.
- `make gen-input`, `make run-a`, `make run-b`, `make run-c`, `make run-d`, `make run-report`, and `make run-abcd` are thin wrappers over `pipeline.py`.
- `make gen-srcs-compile-commands` first refreshes `srcs_sanitized/` from the original `srcs/` Juliet tree, then writes `srcs_sanitized/compile_commands.json` with the default Juliet Win32 shim include, `_WIN32` compile macro, and shared compatibility forced include; it does not run Stage `A`.
- Stage `A` default root runs emit `samples.raw.jsonl`, `samples.stats.jsonl`, and `samples.llm.jsonl`.
- Stage `A` exits non-zero if any project record is invalid or mining fails, so root chained runs stop before Stage `B` consumes empty stats.
- Stage `A` input generation is explicit and requires an existing `compile_commands.json`; it writes `extensions.analysis_timeout=1800` by default and must not fall back to guessing compile flags from bare source scans.
- Stage `A` LLM evidence is produced through `a/cmd/llm_export.py` as part of the root `a` and `abcd` flows.
- Stage `B` expects Stage `A` `samples.stats.jsonl` records with schema `stagea.stats.features.v1` plus matching `samples.llm.jsonl` evidence keyed by `sample_id`, and validates those contracts before mining.
- Stage `B` writes complete seed-level scored candidates to `candidates.scored.jsonl` and writes the route-aggregated C-ready queue to `candidates.for_c.jsonl` with schema `stageb.c_ready_candidates.v3`; each C-ready record keeps only Stage `C` input fields, stores merged Stage `A` LLM evidence under `llm_evidence`, and carries route-level B metadata under `stage_b`, including risk score weights, `static_confirmation_support`, `c_priority_score`, and `c_priority_components`. B sorts the C-ready queue by `c_priority_score` first to front-load candidates more likely to become Stage `C` `P0`/`P1`/`P2` under a time budget; `threshold_pass` is a bounded evidence bonus rather than a hard high/low priority band. This score is computed only from B-available route scores, source/sink kinds, seed tokens, route/file text, and evidence slices, not from Stage `C` or Stage `D` runtime outputs.
- Stage `C` expects Stage `B` `candidates.for_c.jsonl`; it must not read Stage `A` outputs directly, and it uses `stage_b` threshold/missing-feature/seed-token/reference-sample/C-priority/static-confirmation evidence as anti-hallucination constraints rather than vulnerability conclusions. Stage `C` validates `stage_b.static_confirmation_support` and does not allow P0 static confirmation when B marks static confirmation unsupported; such vulnerability findings stay in the dynamic-verification path.
- Stage `C` uses a process-based time budget when requested and does not expose a candidate-count limit; after the deadline plus grace, unfinished workers are terminated and their candidates are written as `P3` `stage_c_time_budget_exhausted` audit records. Stage `C` audits each Stage `B` route record independently and must not reuse benchmark-template answers across sibling records.
- Stage `C` writes `P1`/`P2` dynamic-verification candidates to `c/out/*.jsonl`. Completed `P0` static confirmations are also written to `c/out/*.jsonl` so Stage `D` can route-bound verify them; Stage `C` time budgets only affect candidate submission and unfinished workers, not whether a completed P0 is handed to D. `P3` audit-only records go to `c/audit/audit.jsonl`; completed Stage `C` records store fixed two-agent rounds under `agent_rounds`: red `red_proposer`, blue `blue_challenger`, and red `red_rebuttal`. Records enter `P3` only when all completed non-error agent rounds return no vulnerability and no deterministic source/API semantic safety net recognizes an unchecked failure route. `P1` means the final red rebuttal still reports a vulnerability and at least two rounds support the vulnerability, including first-round no-vulnerability findings corrected by blue plus red and first-round findings reaffirmed after the blue challenge. Otherwise, any record with at least one vulnerability round but without stable final support is `P2`. LLM/API failures do not count as no-vulnerability votes and are routed with `stage_c_llm_error` or `stage_c_partial_llm_error`. The safety net emits semantic hypothesis evidence and routes to `P1` without requiring or synthesizing a CWE label.
- Stage `C` outputs hypothesis and routing evidence only. It must not infer or emit D verifier configuration, `verification_context`, or oracle rules; Stage `D` owns verifier/oracle generation.
- Stage `C` uses the DeepSeek-compatible OpenAI Python SDK client configured in `c/agent1.py`; `make run-abcd` reaches this networked LLM call and requires `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`. `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` and `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` may override the defaults.
- Stage `D` batch mode expects Stage `C` dynamic-verification candidates under `c/out/*.jsonl`; it reads those files in filename order, trusts Stage `C` routing instead of re-checking `P1`/`P2` or `agent_verdict`, rejects duplicate `project_id + hypothesis_id` records, and must not read Stage `A` or Stage `B` outputs directly. Stage `D` applies a 10-second execution timeout only to `P0`; `P1`/`P2` records are not D-time-limited.
- Stage `D` streaming mode is used by root `abcd`; it follows the current Stage `C --output` JSONL file, processes only complete newline-terminated records, rejects duplicate `project_id + hypothesis_id` records, writes to `d/memberD_verifier/02_run_with_C/output/<run-name>/`, and exits after the root pipeline marks Stage `C` done. The `<run-name>` is `--report-run-name` / `REPORT_RUN_NAME` when supplied, otherwise the normalized Stage `A` input `project_id`.
- Stage `D` batch and streaming modes share an output lock under `d/memberD_verifier/02_run_with_C/.stage_d_output.lock`; do not run another D writer while one mode is active.
- Stage `D` verifies C/C++ source/API misuse hypotheses and does not generate HTTP requests, `base_url` payloads, or `*.http` files.
- Stage `D` must not collapse verifier capability gaps into `NOT_EXPLOITABLE`. When the selected route executes but D emits `UNSUPPORTED_ORACLE`, D writes a `stage_c_preserved` reportable record to `verification.jsonl` only for Stage `C` `P0`/`P1`, preserving fields such as `priority`, `routing_decision`, `suspicion_reason`, and `agent_verdict`. `P2` plus `UNSUPPORTED_ORACLE` is written to `verification.failed.jsonl` with `failure_code=UNSUPPORTED_ORACLE`. `NOT_EXPLOITABLE` is reserved for cases where a supported oracle profile ran and did not confirm the vulnerability.
- Stage `D` selects reusable oracle profiles from the hypothesis API names, route text, attack path, evidence slice, and claim wording; CWE fields are optional tie-breakers, not required inputs. Oracle profiles are project-agnostic and must not contain benchmark-specific code or marker names. Generated plans and reportable/failed records may include `oracle_profile_id` and `oracle_profile_supported` so profile coverage can be audited.
- Stage `D` target generation first emits project-agnostic source/API targets. Project/environment execution context must be supplied explicitly through `--contexts` / `--d-contexts` sidecars or explicit targets with `repo_path`, `run_cmd`/`poc_cmd`/`test_cmd`, and oracle fields; core target generation must not auto-detect benchmark or project-family execution. Generated source/API runners expose `MAGUS_D_PROJECT_ID`, `MAGUS_D_SAMPLE_ID`, `MAGUS_D_HYPOTHESIS_ID`, `MAGUS_D_ROUTE`, `MAGUS_D_FILE`, `MAGUS_D_LINE`, `MAGUS_D_ENTRY_SYMBOL`, `MAGUS_D_ORACLE_PROFILE_ID`, `MAGUS_D_PAYLOAD`, `MAGUS_D_PAYLOAD_MARKER`, and `MAGUS_D_CONFIRM_PATTERNS_JSON` to harness commands so sidecar-provided projects can emit route-bound `MAGUS_ROUTE_EXECUTED` and project-agnostic `MAGUS_ORACLE_*` markers. The generic search-path profile covers `putenv`, `_putenv`, `_wputenv`, `SetEnvironmentVariableA/W`, `SearchPathA/W`, `SetDllDirectoryA/W`, and `AddDllDirectory`; project helper scripts may map runtime observations to those markers, but the oracle profile must remain benchmark-agnostic.
- Stage `D` confirmed output requires route-bound dynamic evidence plus oracle-profile-specific semantic evidence. The executable harness can run the full source project/testcase, but its oracle must prove the candidate route or source/API sequence was reached; otherwise the record stays in failed output, using `NOT_ROUTE_BOUND` when route attribution cannot be proven. For return-value/privilege-drop profiles, simply forcing an API failure is not enough; the oracle must observe route-bound post-failure misuse such as `RevertToSelf` after failed impersonation or an unpropagated `RpcImpersonateClient` failure. `stage_c_preserved` records are not D-confirmed; they are reportable pass-through records used only for `P0`/`P1` when route execution succeeds and D explicitly lacks an oracle for the hypothesis semantics.
- Report writes final report artifacts `report/<run-name>/verification.report.jsonl` and `report/<run-name>/verification.report.md` from Stage `D` `verification.jsonl` and `verification.failed.jsonl`. In root `abcd`, the same `<run-name>` selects both D `output/<run-name>/` and Report `report/<run-name>/`; `REPORT_RUN_NAME` / `--report-run-name` overrides the Stage `A` input `project_id`. Report-only runs derive `<run-name>` from the unique `project_id` in D output unless `--run-name` is supplied. Each reportable vulnerability report row must include location (`file_path`, `line`, `route`), vulnerability type, risk level, and trigger condition. The Report validator checks that the report has one row per `verification.jsonl` reportable record and accepts `confirmed` plus `P0`/`P1` `stage_c_preserved` statuses.
- `test/evaluate_juliet_report.py` compares `report/<run-name>/verification.report.jsonl` with Juliet answers for paper testing. By default it infers Juliet truth from original bad/good testcase paths under `srcs/juliet-api-misuse`, maps sanitized report paths back through `srcs_sanitized/juliet_sanitization_map.json`, and can also consume an explicit JSONL/JSON/CSV answer file. It writes evaluation artifacts under `test/out/juliet_eval/<run-name>/` unless `--out-dir` is supplied, and reports false positives, false negatives, duplicate true positives, precision/recall/F1, and elapsed time from Stage `A` start to final report generation when `--stage-a-start`, `--timing-json`, or `--run-command` is supplied.
- `test/run_lazy_batch.py` runs the adapted Juliet source/API misuse queue from `test/lazy.md` one CWE folder at a time, preserving per-folder logs and summaries under `test/out/lazy_batch/<run-id>/`. It explicitly generates a Juliet/Linux D sidecar with `tools/gen_juliet_verification_contexts.py` and passes it through `--d-contexts`; core Stage `D` must not auto-detect Juliet. The queue must contain only CWE folders whose decisive source/API behavior maps to a route-bound Stage `D` oracle profile with matching project-agnostic semantic evidence, or an explicit `UNSUPPORTED_ORACLE` preservation path for Stage `C` `P0`/`P1`; memory-safety-only folders such as stack/heap buffer overflows stay out of this queue unless D gains an explicit verifier/oracle profile for them.
- The root pipeline does not currently expose a Stage `B` worker-count flag.
